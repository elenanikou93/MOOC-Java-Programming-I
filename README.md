# MOOC-Java-Programming-I
My implementations for all Java Programming I exercises for the MOOC of University of Helsinki.

I followed the course coding in Visual Studio Code because I couldn't get TMCBeans to work.
The solutions are not double-checked, they passed the tests but any feedback or different implementation for the exercises is always welcome.
